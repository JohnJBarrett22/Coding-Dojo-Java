# Display Date

Your project manager needs you to make two templates for her front-end team: one to display the current date, and one to display the current time. Use the JSTL library to format the date so the front end developers can edit easily!

## Topics:
● Passing Data

● Routing

● Time formatting

## Tasks:
● Use new java.util.Date() in your controller to get the date.

● Create an app that will render three pages.

● Render one home page as the dashboard with links to the two others.

● Render one page at /date with the current date formatted as Saturday, the 22 of January, 2028

● Link an external javascript file to the /date template that alerts "This is the date template".

● Link an external css file to the /date template that colors the date in blue.

● Render one page at /time with the current time formatted as 11:30 PM

● Link a external javascript file to the /time template that alerts "This is the time template".

● Link a external css file to the /time template that that colors the time in green.
