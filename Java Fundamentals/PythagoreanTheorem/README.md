# Pythagorean Theorem

In this assignment, you will create a Java program to implement the Pythagorean Theorem.

To complete this assignment, you will need the Math class from the java.lang package. This package provides fundamentals classes to the Java programming language such as Object, Boolean, String, Integer, Math, etc. Therefore, the java.lang package is automatically imported and ready to use in every Java program.

## Objectives:
* Learn how to import a class into your project.
* Practice object instantiation.
* Practice method invocation.
* Use the java.lang package.

## Tasks:
* Create a Pythagorean class in javaFun.
* Use a method from the Math class to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the values of the two legs. HINT: Use the static sqrt method. Static means that the method belongs to the class instead of the object. Here is some sample code:
* Create a PythagoreanTest file that will instantiate a new Pythagorean object and call the calculateHypotenuse method.
