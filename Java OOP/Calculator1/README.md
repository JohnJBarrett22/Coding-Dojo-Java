# Calculator Part I

A client of yours requires a basic calculator for their application. They need a way to run a series of operations and save the result. They only need adding and subtracting functionality right now. They need the method performOperation and getResults to be the methods that run all the operations and return the end result respectively.

* setOperandOne(10.5)
* setOperation("+")
* setOperandTwo(5.2)
* performOperation()
* getResults()

...where the result would be 15.7.

## Objectives:
* Practice classes and objects.
* Implement a calculator in java.

## Tasks:
* Create the Calculator bean that will allow for the user to set operands and operations, then perform them and get the results.
* Have logic for adding and subtracting.
