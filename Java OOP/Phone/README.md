# Phone Assignment

In this assignment, we are going to use Abstract classes and Interfaces to create 2 types of phones: iPhone and Galaxy.

## Objectives:

* Define classes.
* Define Interfaces.

Implement classes that use abstract classes and interfaces.

## Tasks:
Create a Phone abstract class.

Create a Ringable interface that contains the following methods:
* ring(): This method returns a String.
* unlock(): This method returns a String.

Create an IPhone and Galaxy classes. Both classes should extend from the Phone abstract class and implement the Ringable interface.

Implement the overriden methods (ring, unlock, displayInfo) from the IPhone and Galaxy classes according to the PhoneTester file below.
