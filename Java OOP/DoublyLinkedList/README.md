# DLL Assignment

In this assignment, you will implement common methods for Doubly Linked Lists:
* void printValuesBackward(): This method prints the values of the nodes from the tail to the head.
* Node pop(): This method removes the last node of our DLL and returns it.
* boolean contains(Integer value): This method returns a boolean whether the value in the argument is in the list or not. Return true if the value exists, else, return false.
* int size(): Returns the number of nodes in the list.

If you completed all the methods above, challenge yourself and try the following:
* void insertAt(Node newNode, int index): Inserts a node at a specific index. For example, let's say that we have 3 nodes in our list. If we call insertAt(newNode, 1), the newNode should be inserted right after the head. (head is index 0)
* void removeAt(int index): This method removes a node at an index. For example, let's say that we have 3 nodes in our list. If we call removeAt(1), the middle node is removed. (head is index 0)
* boolean isPalindrome(): This method returns a boolean whether the node is a palindrome or not. Return true if it is a palindrome, else, return false.
