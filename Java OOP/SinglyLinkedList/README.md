# Singly Linked List

In this assignment, you will create your own implementation of a singly linked list in Java. You will need 3 files: Node.java, SinglyLinkedList.java, and ListTester.java. As long as these files are in the same directory, you will not need to import them explicitily. We recommend that you create a ListAssignment folder and place your 3 files there.

## Objectives:
* Practice creating classes and objects.
* Learn and implement a singly linked list in Java.

## Tasks:
* Create a Node class like the above.
* Fill in the constructor method that sets the value to a given number and next to null of your Node objects.
* Create a SinglyLinkedList class like the above.
* Create a constructor method that sets the head to null of your SinglyLinkedList objects
* Create a remove() method that will remove a node from the end of your list
* Create printValues() method that will print all the values of each node in the list in order
* Create a ListTester class like the above.

## Optional Challenges:
* Implement a find(int) method that will return the first node with the value in the parameter
* Implement a removeAt(int) method that will remove the node after n nodes, where n is the parameter. For example, if n is 0, remove the first node. If n is 1, remove the second node. Similar to Arrays.
